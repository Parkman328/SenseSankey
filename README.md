Troubleshooting
If you install Qlik Sense and the Extensions as instructed but get the error “Invalid Visualization”, it most likely is because Qlik Sense occasionally has problems with its cache. To resolve this issue you need to clear the browser cache, but how you do that depends on how you run Qlik Sense.

Below you will find a short step by step guide on how to clear the cache depending on how you run Qlik Sense desktop. Terminology may differ between languages but the functionality should be the same.

<b>The Desktop Application</b>

Navigate to the app you are having problems with.
Hold Ctrl+Shift and right click anywhere in the app.
Click the “Show DevTools” option.
Once the DevTools tab is open you will find a tab called “Network”, located between “Elements” and “Sources”. Click it.
On the very top of the “Network” tab you will find the check box “Disable Cache”. Check it if not already checked.
Now, navigate back to the app you were having problems with and hit F5 to refresh.
If you have the same problem with other apps just repeat the process with that app.

<b>Google Chrome</b>

Navigate to the app you are having problems with.
Press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+j to open the developer tools.
Once the developer tools page is open you will find a tab called “Network”. It will be between “Elements” and “Sources”. Click it.
On the very top of the “Network” tab you will find the check box “Disable Cache”. Check it if not already checked.
Hit F5 to refresh.
You can now close the developer tools by pressing F12 again.

If you have the same problem with other apps, just repeat the process with that app.

<b>Firefox</b>

Navigate to the app you are having problems with.
Press F12 to open the developer tools.
Once the developer tools page is open you will find an icon that looks like a small cogwheel. It is located in the top-right corner of the developer tools. Click it.
Look for a check box labeled “Disable Cache”. Check it if not already checked.
Hit F5 to refresh.
You can now close the developer tools by pressing F12 again.

If you have the same problem with other apps, just repeat the process with that app.

<b>Internet Explorer</b>

This is for Internet Explorer 9, but the steps for Internet Explorer 10 and 11 is most likely very similar.

Navigate to the Menu Button (the one looking like a small cogwheel) and click it.
Navigate to the “Safety” option and click the “Delete Browsing History” button.
Uncheck everything except “Preserve Favorites website data” and “Temporary Internet files”.
Press Delete.
Hit F5 to refresh.
If you have the same problem with other apps, just repeat the process with that app.

Once an app is working the cache should not be a problem again.
